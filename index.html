                            My interest in web development started back in winter break during my sophomore year when I
                            decided to
                            try out building an online portfolio —— and now, I am immersed in the <span
                                class="bold-text">wonderful sea of web coding</span>, unable to extricate myself! I am
                            planning to study courses related to full-stack development and hci.</p>

                                    <p>This is the term project for CMU 15-112: Fundamentals of Programming. In this TP,
                                        my goal was to rebuild the popular tower-defense game, Plants vs Zombies using
                                        Python and the CMU 112 graphics package.
                                        The game was originally developed by PopCap Games and published by Electronic
                                        Arts. I will make a simplified version of that, which will only include a few
                                        types of plants, zombies, and two levels (the day level and the night level).
                                        The player's goal is to successfully defeat waves of zombies using the plants
                                        that are provided for each level.
                                    </p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Level descriptions:</p>
                                    <p>Normal Level:</p>
                                    <p>The player will be provided five types of plants (sunflower, peashooter, walnut
                                        and potato mine, kernel pult). The player needs to defend 3 waves of zombies.
                                    </p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Hard Level:</p>
                                    <p>The player will be provided four types of plants (sunflower, peashooter, walnut,
                                        and kernel pult). The number of waves increase to 4 waves.
                                    </p>

                                        goal of Tetris is to score as many points as possible by clearing horizontal

                                    <p>It all began with the idea of organizing my portfolio since my major was
                                        architecture. But when going through all those popular websites for portfolio
                                        making, I wasn't satisfied with the template they provided. Also, I didn't like
                                        to have ".wix.com" as such a name on my website URL (overall, having to pay
                                        monthly subscriptions, etc made me I felt that my freedom in design was
                                        limited). That's why this website was born!</p>

                                    <p>Besides that, I also want to have a place to record all the cool projects I've
                                        worked on. I used to have all my projects stored in a folder on my USB, but how
                                        long till that USB is left in some corners of my house and then is gone forever.
                                        After 10 or 20 years, it would be a shame if I don't have a collection of the
                                        projects and memories of the people I have worked with. I hope to make this
                                        website my journey of growth.

                                        bank account, yet I was shocked by how careless and disastrous their website
                                        design was. Maybank is one of Malaysia's biggest banking service providers, but
                                        its main web page is destroying that title. Their webpage has hunted me for a
                                        long time, and when I got to learn HTML, CSS, and JS, I felt that I finally have
                                        the chance to do something about their website (even though it won't change the
                                        difference between their website, but at least I think I could have a better
                                        design than the current one).
                                    </p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Hence, I've decided to take on this project as a personal interested to redesign
                                        the website.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Maybank is a Malaysian universal bank, with the key markets in Singapore,
                                        Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is Malaysia's largest bank by market capitalization
                                        and total assets and one of the largest banks in Southeast Asia.
                                    </p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Despite this great influence in Malaysia, Maybank's website is constantly facing
                                        negative reviews from consumers. </p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>So, what is the problem? </p>
                                    <br>

                                        **UPDATE: The official website has been updated while this project was done in
                                        March 2022. Therefore the description and the image below
                                        might not look like what the current official MayBank website is.
                                    </p>

                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>This is the front page of Maybank website. As you can see, the site contains so
                                        many components and buttons. I got a headache by reading all of these features.
                                        It really left me with an impression of a school project done at the last
                                        minute.</p>
                                    <br>

                                    <p>Upon reviewing the website, I concluded three major problems with the design:
                                    </p>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>The horizontal scrolling:</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>It's hard to navigate and especially when they have an unusual horizontal
                                        scrolling design, which already confused so many users from the start.
                                    </p>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>The dropdown navigation:</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Having a gigantic universal blackhole of the dropdown menu is also a minus to the
                                        design. There are so many information given to me and also with the color of the
                                        background, it really becomes unpleasant to read.
                                    </p>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Lack of target consumer group:</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>When I entered the main page intending to open a bank account, I was genuinely
                                        lost in this overwhelming content and not sure where to click. All the titles
                                        and boxes are designed in a similar format and it is hard to find the main
                                        target from this site. Just try to imagine, an investor trying to invest in this
                                        bank or a student wanting to get an internship from the website. They might
                                        already move on to the next company when seeing this site.
                                    </p>
                                    <br>

                                    <h3 id="myProposal">My Proposal </h3>
                                    <h4 class="inside-title">New Website Design</h4>
                                    <p>The intention for this site design is to keep it simple and intuitive since
                                        Maybank targets user groups with all sorts of demographic. Therefore, I first
                                        changed the scrolling style to a vertical one. Then I spilt the main page into
                                        three sections: the first one is the landing page showing all the categories the
                                        users want to search for from the bank. Moving on to the second section, we will
                                        see the recent news and a convenient service section that provides quick
                                        navigation for users. Then the last section is the “call to action” section,
                                        which includes donation ads, and new events from the bank that draws users'
                                        attention.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Of course, this is not the perfect design solution for Maybank, and I know there
                                        needs to be real user testing and feedback to achieve the result. Therefore, I
                                        will continue to learn new skills to improve the web experience and also
                                        updating the design styles.
